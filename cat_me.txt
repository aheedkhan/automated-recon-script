if you didnt read the instructions on github then this is for you my helpless friend :)


this script is designed for kali linux, also run this via following commands:
chmod +x dependency_install.sh
sudo ./dependency_install.sh

if you get any error like #include<pcap.h> missing or not found then run:
# update & install build deps (run as root or with sudo)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libpcap-dev

# ensure your Go env is ready for user installs
# run as your normal user (not root) so go install writes to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin
# replace <your-username> or run in your user shell
su - "$SUDO_USER" -c 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go; export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin; mkdir -p $GOPATH $GOBIN; /usr/bin/env go install github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest'


then run:
sudo python hahahehe.py target.com (only domain, no https or /pages/adshkad you know what i m talking about :)
